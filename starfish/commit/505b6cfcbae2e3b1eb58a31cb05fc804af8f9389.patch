+# Project Starfish
+
+GSOC 2020 Starfish POC
+
+This repo is mainly to have conversations/discussions around the https://docs.jboss.org/display/GSOC/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+ideas[Starfish GSOC idea under JBoss.org].
+
+Below is an update of the original outline of the idea:
+
+## Project Starfish - Open anything anywhere in any IDE/editor
+
+*Summary of idea*:
+
+- Implement a client side app that supports urlhandlers (i.e. `ide://clone-url?url=https://github` ... , `ide://open-file?`, `ide://open-debugger?port=..&project=url`, etc.)
+- Then integrate these various actions to perform and setup in vscode, eclipse, intellij, emacs, vi, etc.
+- Make it work across Linux, OSX and Windows so it can be used from anywhere.
+- Possible make browser extensions to enable it on various websites like github, gitlab, etc.
+
+This project will need some level of research:
+
+- How to setup url handlers on all three major platforms
+- Understand the basic functionallity of at least three IDEs/Editors open/clone features to show it will work
+- Explore extendability of browers or IDE's as needed
+- Possible tasks for this project:
+  - Implement cross-platform app
+  - Add tests
+  - Write documentation
+  - Prepare demos
+
+### Knowledge prerequisite: 
+
+- Open choice on language, but most likely Java, or Go based
+- Basic understanding of IDE and/or Browser extensions
+- Access to more than one of the Operating Systems, virtual machines okey.
+
+### Github repo:
+
+  Since this is a new idea there are no direct current github repo for it - for now created https://github.com/maxandersen/starfish for having a place of discussion/conversion. If you want to explore/work in this area and show your experience/interest you can look into contributing to projects like  https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang or any vscode-* repo under https://github.com/redhat-developer/  or for more advanced
+
+        https://github.com/quarkusio.  Basically any project that relates to developer tools, desktop tools, scripts or browser extensions will be useful experience. 
+
+### Slides:
+
+  An outline of the idea with some screenshots/overview can be found https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AwWtUVz04b5u2I3QB-fEevzpyAJLSE1PzdS0JjnVoO0/edit#slide=id.pp[here] - feel free to comment.
