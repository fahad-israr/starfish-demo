 # creating custom url handlers on linux:
-### Note: Still Working to enhance
-- To register a new URL scheme handler with XDG, first create a Desktop Entry which specifies the x-scheme-handler/... MIME type:
-```
-[Desktop Entry]
-Type=Application
-Name=IDE Scheme Handler
-Exec=open-ide.sh %u
-StartupNotify=false
-MimeType=x-scheme-handler/ide;
-```
-- Note that %u passes the URL (e.g. ide://query%20terms) as a single parameter, according to the [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#exec-variables) .
 
-- Once we have created this Desktop Entry and installed it (i.e. put it in the local or system applications directory for XDG, like ~/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/), then we must register the application with the MIME type (assuming we had named your Desktop Entry ide-opener.desktop):
-
-`xdg-mime default ide-opener.desktop x-scheme-handler/ide`
-
-A reference implementation of the `ide-open.sh` handler:
-
-```
-#!/bin/bash
-
-# bash and not just sh because we are using some bash-specific syntax
-
-if [[ "$1" == "ide:"* ]]; then
-    ref=${1#ide://}
-    #ref=$(python -c "import sys, urllib as ul; print ul.unquote_plus(sys.argv[1])" "$ref") # If we want decoding
-    xdg-open "https://github.com/?q=$ref"
-else
-    xdg-open "$1" # Just open with the default handler
-fi
-
-  
-```

+- Clone the files you see above  (`ide-handler, ide-handler.desktop, install`)
+- run `sudo bash install` in console
+- That's it!!
